# ExrMedia

Unreal Engine 4 Media Framework plug-in for EXR image sequences.


## About

This plug-in is still under development. The current implementation is just a
proof of concept and not ready for production yet. It will be improved in the
coming weeks.

Make sure to pull the *Tag* that matches your Unreal Engine version. If you sync
to *Master* the code may not compile, because it may depend on Engine changes
that are not yet available in the UE4 Master branch.


## Supported Platforms

This plug-in was last built against **Unreal Engine 4.15** and tested
against the following platforms:

- Windows


## Prerequisites

None.


## Dependencies

This plug-in requires Visual Studio and either a C++ code project or the full
Unreal Engine 4 source code from GitHub. If you are new to programming in UE4,
please see the official [Programming Guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/index.html)! 


## Usage

You can use this plug-in as a project plug-in, or an Engine plug-in.

If you use it as a project plug-in, clone this repository into your project's
*/Plugins* directory and compile your game in Visual Studio. A C++ code project
is required for this to work.

If you use it as an Engine plug-in, clone this repository into the
*/Engine/Plugins/Media* directory and compile your game. Full Unreal Engine 4
source code from GitHub is required for this.
